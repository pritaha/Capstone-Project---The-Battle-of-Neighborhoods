# Capstone-Project---The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Coursera capstone final project

## Description of the problem and a discussion of the background:
This final project aims to solve the problem of opening a new restaurant in the city of Madrid, Spain. 
Currently, there is no specific type of restaurant, as first we would like to know what types of restaurants can be encountered in the different neighbourhoods of the city. 

## Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem:
The data to take a desicion on what type of restaurant and what neighbourhood to choose will be a database generated from the information avaivable at Foursquare. 
Once the data is obtained, a map will be generated representing the neighbourhoods of Madrid and a study on the density of restaurants will be conducted.
